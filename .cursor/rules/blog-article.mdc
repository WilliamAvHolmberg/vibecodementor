# Blog Writing Guidelines for VibeCodeMentor

## üéØ Philosophy: Authentic Voice + Professional Polish
- **Keep the authentic, passionate voice** - don't sanitize the personality
- **Professional but not corporate** - we're building in public, not selling enterprise
- **Opinionated content is good** - strong takes generate engagement
- **Focus on practical insights** - what can readers actually learn/apply?

## üìÅ File Structure & Setup

### 1. Create New Blog Post
```
frontend/src/app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx
```
- Use kebab-case for slugs (e.g., `amazing-time-to-be-alive`)
- Each blog post is a separate Next.js page (rawdog approach, not generic)

### 2. Metadata Template
```typescript
export const metadata: Metadata = {
  title: '[Blog Title] | VibeCodeMentor',
  description: 'Compelling 1-2 sentence description under 160 chars',
  openGraph: {
    title: '[Blog Title]',
    description: 'Same as above description',
    type: 'article',
    publishedTime: '2024-01-XX', // Use actual date
    authors: ['William Holmberg'],
  },
};
```

### 3. Component Structure
```typescript
export default function [BlogName]BlogPost() {
  return (
    <div className="min-h-screen bg-white dark:bg-gray-950">
      {/* Header Section */}
      {/* Main Content */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

## üé® Design Standards

### Header Section (Always Include)
- Back navigation: `‚Üê Back to VibeCodeMentor`
- Date meta (format: "July 4, 2025")
- Large, clean title (3xl on mobile, 5xl on desktop)
- Compelling subtitle/description
- No hero images - keep it text-focused

### Content Styling
- Use `prose prose-lg dark:prose-invert max-w-none` for article wrapper
- Consistent heading hierarchy (h2 for main sections)
- Proper spacing: `mb-6` between paragraphs, `mt-12` before new sections
- Blockquotes for key quotes/insights
- Lists for actionable items or key points

### Call-to-Action Footer
- Always end with engaging CTA section
- Two buttons: primary (GitHub/template), secondary (homepage)
- Inspiring closing message with emoji

## üìù Content Guidelines

### Opening Hook
- Start with a strong, opinionated statement
- Make it personal - "I think...", "I've seen..."
- Set the stage for what you're going to argue/explain

### Structure That Works
1. **Hook** - grab attention immediately
2. **Problem/Context** - what's the current situation?
3. **Your Take** - why is this important/different?
4. **Evidence/Examples** - back up your claims
5. **Future Vision** - where is this heading?
6. **Action Items** - what should readers do?

### Voice & Tone
- ‚úÖ **Passionate**: "fucking fantastic", "beyond me"
- ‚úÖ **Confident**: Strong statements, clear positions
- ‚úÖ **Personal**: Share experiences, use "I"
- ‚úÖ **Practical**: Focus on what people can actually do
- ‚ùå **Corporate speak**: Avoid buzzwords and safe language
- ‚ùå **Wishy-washy**: Don't hedge every statement

### Technical Content
- Explain context for non-technical readers
- Use concrete examples over abstract concepts
- Link to relevant tools/resources
- Balance technical depth with accessibility

## üß≠ Navigation Integration

### Adding to Header Menu
1. Open `frontend/src/shared/components/app-header.tsx`
2. Find the Articles dropdown section
3. Add new link at the TOP (newest first):

```typescript
<a
  href="/blog/your-new-slug"
  className="flex items-center w-full px-3 py-3 text-sm font-medium text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 hover:text-purple-600 dark:hover:text-purple-400 hover:bg-gradient-to-r hover:from-purple-50 hover:to-blue-50 dark:hover:from-purple-900/20 dark:hover:to-blue-900/20 rounded-xl transition-all duration-200 cursor-pointer leading-relaxed block"
>
  Your Blog Title
</a>
```

4. Adjust dropdown width if needed (`w-72`, `w-80`, etc.)

## üö® Common Mistakes to Avoid

- **Generic titles** - be specific and opinionated
- **Buried lede** - get to the point quickly
- **Too much hedging** - commit to your positions
- **No clear takeaway** - what should readers do?
- **Corporate tone** - keep it human and passionate
- **Wall of text** - break up with headings, lists, quotes
- **Weak endings** - finish strong with clear CTAs

## üé® Styling Reference

### Key Classes
- Article wrapper: `prose prose-lg dark:prose-invert max-w-none`
- Main heading: `text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mb-6 mt-12`
- Body text: `text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6`
- Blockquote: `border-l-4 border-blue-500 pl-6 italic text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 my-8`
- Lists: `space-y-2` for proper spacing

### Responsive Considerations
- Test on mobile - long titles should wrap nicely
- Ensure proper spacing on all screen sizes
- CTAs should stack on mobile, inline on desktop
