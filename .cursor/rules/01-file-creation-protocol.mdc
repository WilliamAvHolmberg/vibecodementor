description: Strict protocol for creating new files to avoid duplication and drift
alwaysApply: true
---

### **Before creating any new file**
- Run an explicit directory listing of the target folder.
- Search the entire repo with fuzzy/name and content search for similar filenames and responsibilities.
- Check parent/related feature folders and existing imports/usages.
- Prefer editing existing files over adding new ones.
- If still unsure, ask for explicit approval before creating the file.

### **After creating a file**
- Add only focused content; avoid broad refactors.
- Ensure build passes; lint if applicable.
- Add tests/docs where meaningful.
