                I think we&apos;re witnessing something extraordinary. We&apos;re seeing the emergence of a new breed of 10x engineers, empowered by AI, and that is <em>fucking fantastic</em>.

                The End of Human Scaling Problems
              </h2>
              
              <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Organizations are finally going to discover what some of us have known for years: <strong>you don&apos;t need 50 engineers working on a simple application</strong>. We&apos;ve been solving human scaling issues rather than technical issues for so many years now, and it&apos;s been holding us back.
              </p>

              <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Think about it. Every successful project I&apos;ve been involved in, we kept it lean—maximum 5 people involved. Everyone took maximum responsibility, really cared about the product. There was ownership, there was pride, there was <em>craftsmanship</em>.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mb-6 mt-12">
                The Problem with More People
              </h2>
              
              <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                But the industry got trapped in this mindset: &ldquo;Let&apos;s just throw more engineers at the problem.&rdquo; This didn&apos;t increase technical complexity—it increased the complexity of having many people involved. And here&apos;s the thing: <strong>when there are too many people, people tend to care less</strong>.
              </p>
              
              <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                It&apos;s basic psychology. When responsibility is diffused across dozens of people, individual accountability disappears. The intimate connection between creator and creation gets lost in layers of abstraction, process, and bureaucracy.
              </p>

                Where AI Actually Shines
              </h2>
              
              <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                This is where AI shines: <strong>allowing fewer people to produce more</strong>. Not by replacing human creativity, insight, or problem-solving, but by amplifying it. By handling the tedious, repetitive, and boilerplate work that used to require entire teams.
              </p>
              
              <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                A single engineer with AI can now prototype, iterate, and ship features that previously required cross-functional teams, endless meetings, and months of coordination. The feedback loop between idea and implementation has collapsed from weeks to hours.

                Let&apos;s be clear about something: <strong>AI is not going to replace every software engineer</strong>. But let&apos;s also be honest: <strong>AI will replace SOME software engineers</strong>. It&apos;s not black or white—it&apos;s a spectrum.
              </p>
              
              <ul className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6 space-y-2">
                <li>• Yes, AI can produce garbage code</li>
                <li>• Yes, AI will replace engineers who don&apos;t adapt</li>
                <li>• Yes, AI amplifies both good and bad practices</li>
                <li>• But AI also enables incredible creativity and productivity</li>
                <li>• AI democratizes software development</li>
                <li>• AI lets us focus on solving real problems, not writing boilerplate</li>

              <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                How anyone can waste time debating this instead of going out there and exploring what&apos;s possible to do <em>today</em> is beyond me.

                We&apos;re witnessing the democratization of software development. Tools that were once available only to well-funded teams are now accessible to anyone with curiosity and determination.
